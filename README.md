# Countrypedia
This project is a Country Information Web App. The purpose of this app is to allow users to search for information about a specific country by entering its name. The app uses the Restcountries API to fetch detailed data about a country and displays it in the browser.

Technologies Used:

    HTML: For creating the basic structure.
    CSS: For styling and layout.
    JavaScript: For dynamic behavior and API interaction.
    REST API (Restcountries): To fetch country data based on user input.

This app is a great starting point for learning how to work with APIs and build interactive web applications.
